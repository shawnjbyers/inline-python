# Inline Python
This repository contains nothing but bad hacks.

## How to Use
From a bash prompt, run the following:
```
$ . ./inline-python.bash
$ ilpython print("hello world")
```

## Why?
Because I can, and it's fun.

## How?
This project uses something called a "[magic alias](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/aliases.html)", an unholy union of an alias and a shell function. Don't click that link if you haven't already tried to figure out how it works. Also, it should be noted that the author of the linked article listed this particular hack as a "related hack" and not a "magic alias". Regardless, I'm still going to call it a magic alias.
